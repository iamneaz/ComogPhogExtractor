# ComogPhogExtractor

This project is usedto extract comogphog feature from pdb style files for our bioinformatics 
research project on fast and efficient protein tertiary structure retrieval algorithms.
Here we used some code from an open source image retrieval library "lire" (http://www.semanticmetadata.net/lire/) 
and  modified some of those code as per our project requirements. This extracted comogphog feature is used to 
compare protein tertiary structure for our academic research on fast and efficient protein tertiary structure retrieval.

As we have added the required codes (some are modified as per project requirements), there is no need
to add full library to the build path.

We also acknowledge and thank to the contributor of the open source lire library.

For further query about the codes, please feel free to email.
